# Haskell

Haskell is standardized, general purpose purely functional programming
language, with non strict evaluation and strong static typing.

Haskell is standardized because a specification has been written which defines
how the language and libraries should be implemented. The current standard is
the Haskell 2010 standard. There are many Haskell implementations, however
Glaskow Haskell Compiler (GHC) currently represents *de facto* standard
implementation.

A general purpose programming language is a programming language that has been
designed for writing software in a wide variety of application domains. In
contrast, a domain specific language is designed to be used within a specific
application domain (e.g., HTML for web pages, Unix shell scripts for data
organization). Haskell has been designed to write any kind of software, not
just one particular application domain.

Functional programming is a programming paradigm (a style of building the
structure and elements of a computer programs) where programs are composed of
expressions. The functional style treats computation as mathematical
expressions and typpically avoids mutable state. In contrast, imperative
programming is a programming paradigm where programs are composed of
statements. Imperative programs change state when commands are executed.
